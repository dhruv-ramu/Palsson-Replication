# Results Directory

This directory contains all analysis results, data files, and visualizations generated by the phenotype phase plane analyses.

## Directory Structure

### `edwards_2001/`
Contains results from the Edwards et al. 2001 reproduction analysis:
- **Data files**: Raw phenotype phase plane data in CSV format
- **Visualizations**: PNG plots showing acetate and succinate vs oxygen relationships
- **Analysis**: Comparison with experimental data from the original paper

### `simple_phpp/`
Contains results from the basic phenotype phase plane analysis:
- **Data files**: Raw phenotype phase plane data in CSV format  
- **Visualizations**: PNG plots showing glucose and acetate vs oxygen relationships
- **Analysis**: Working demonstration of PhPP analysis with common substrates

## File Naming Convention

- **Data files**: `{substrate}_o2_{analysis_type}.csv`
- **Visualizations**: `{substrate}_o2_{analysis_type}.png`
- **Analysis types**: `edwards2001`, `simple_phpp`

## Data Format

CSV files contain the following columns:
- `substrate_flux`: Substrate uptake rate (mmol/gDW/h)
- `o2_flux`: Oxygen uptake rate (mmol/gDW/h)  
- `growth_rate`: Calculated growth rate (1/h)

## Usage

Results can be used for:
- Further analysis and visualization
- Comparison with experimental data
- Validation of metabolic models
- Educational purposes
