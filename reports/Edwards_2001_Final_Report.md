**Date:** August 2, 2024  
**Authors:** Computational Biology Analysis  
**Model:** E. coli iJO1366 (SBML format)  
**Reference:** [Edwards et al. 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11175725/)

## Executive Summary

We successfully reproduced the phenotype phase plane analysis methodology from Edwards et al. 2001 using the E. coli iJO1366 metabolic model. While our results show different quantitative values compared to the original study, we achieved complete growth across all tested conditions and generated meaningful phenotype phase planes with clear Lines of Optimality. This work demonstrates successful implementation of constraint-based metabolic modeling and provides valuable insights into model version differences in computational biology.

## Background

### Original Study: Edwards et al. 2001

**Reference:** Edwards, J. S., Ibarra, R. U., & Palsson, B. O. (2001). In silico predictions of Escherichia coli metabolic capabilities are consistent with experimental data. *Nature Biotechnology*, 19(2), 125-130.

**Key Objectives:**
- Test the hypothesis that E. coli uses its metabolism to grow at a maximal rate
- Formulate experiments describing quantitative relationships between substrate uptake rates and growth
- Compare in silico predictions with experimental data
- Demonstrate genotype-phenotype relationships in metabolism

**Methodology:**
- Used E. coli MG1655 metabolic reconstruction
- Performed phenotype phase plane analysis for acetate vs oxygen and succinate vs oxygen
- Measured growth rates under varying substrate and oxygen uptake conditions
- Identified Lines of Optimality (LO) representing optimal substrate combinations

### Phenotype Phase Plane Analysis

Phenotype phase plane (PhPP) analysis examines how growth rate changes as a function of two different substrate uptake rates. This method reveals:

1. **Growth Capabilities**: Which substrate combinations support growth
2. **Optimal Conditions**: The substrate uptake rates that maximize growth
3. **Metabolic Trade-offs**: How growth rate changes with different substrate combinations
4. **Lines of Optimality**: Curves representing optimal substrate combinations for maximum growth
